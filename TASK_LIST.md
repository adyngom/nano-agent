# CG Workflow Implementation Task List

## üìã Implementation Plan Overview

This task list converts documented CG workflow specifications into tested, functional agents. Focus is on **validation and testing** rather than creating more documentation.

**Goal**: Transform specifications into working agent-centric CG workflow system.

## Phase 1: Validate & Test Existing Agents (Days 1-2)

### Day 1: Agent Validation
- [x] **Test @cg-init agent functionality** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - [x] Test with `@cg-init "I want to build a task management app"`
  - [x] Verify project state detection logic works
  - [x] Validate routing decisions (new vs existing projects)
  - [x] Document any issues or improvements needed
  - **Result**: Agent working perfectly! Correctly detected partial completion state and recommended proper workflow routing.

- [x] **Test @cg-analyzer agent** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - [x] Test with a sample GitHub issue
  - [x] Verify CG_TDD_<issue>.md generation
  - [x] Check context reading from PRD/UX files
  - [x] Validate technical analysis quality
  - **Result**: Agent working excellently! Generated comprehensive CG_TDD_42.md with architecture decisions, security considerations, performance implications, and implementation strategy.

- [x] **Test @cg-planner agent** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - [x] Test with existing analysis document
  - [x] Verify CG_TDD_TESTS_<issue>.md generation
  - [x] Check test strategy comprehensiveness
  - [x] Validate TDD methodology adherence
  - **Result**: Agent working excellently! Generated comprehensive CG_TDD_TESTS_42.md with unit/integration/e2e test specifications, mock strategy, coverage requirements, and proper TDD implementation order.

### Day 2: Agent Coordination Testing
- [ ] **Test agent handoff workflow**
  - [ ] Run @cg-init ‚Üí @cg-analyzer ‚Üí @cg-planner sequence
  - [ ] Verify file-based state passing works

### Day 5: Agent Integration Testing
- [ ] **Test complete workflow end-to-end**
  - [ ] New project: idea ‚Üí PRD ‚Üí UX ‚Üí technical implementation
  - [ ] Existing project: issue analysis ‚Üí testing ‚Üí implementation
  - [ ] Legacy project: modernization ‚Üí TDD integration
  - [ ] Document any remaining issues

## Phase 3: Hook Implementation (Days 6-7)

### Day 6: Session Hook Enhancement
- [ ] **Enhance .claude/hooks/session_start.py**
  - [ ] Add agent detection patterns
  - [ ] Implement suggestion logic
  - [ ] Test with various user inputs
  - [ ] Ensure non-intrusive suggestions

- [ ] **Create intelligent routing**
  - [ ] Detect "I want to build..." ‚Üí suggest @cg-init
  - [ ] Detect "implement issue #X" ‚Üí suggest @cg-analyzer
  - [ ] Detect "add tests to..." ‚Üí suggest @cg-legacy
  - [ ] Test all routing patterns

### Day 7: Post-Tool Hook Enhancement  
- [ ] **Enhance .claude/hooks/post_tool_use.py**
  - [ ] Add agent coordination suggestions
  - [ ] Implement workflow progression hints
  - [ ] Create state tracking updates
  - [ ] Test agent handoff automation

## Phase 4: Production Readiness (Days 8-10)

### Day 8: Documentation & Examples
- [ ] **Create usage documentation**
  - [ ] Agent usage patterns and examples
  - [ ] Workflow progression guides
  - [ ] Troubleshooting and recovery
  - [ ] Best practices and tips

- [ ] **Test with real projects**
  - [ ] Use on actual development tasks
  - [ ] Validate with team members
  - [ ] Collect feedback and issues
  - [ ] Document improvements needed

### Day 9: Integration Testing
- [ ] **Test with nano-agent MCP server**
  - [ ] Verify all agents work via mcp__nano-agent__prompt_nano_agent
  - [ ] Test multi-provider model usage
  - [ ] Validate cost optimization strategies
