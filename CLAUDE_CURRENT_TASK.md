 Following the architectural revision to an agent-centric     
 approach, we are now implementing the core CG workflow       
 agents in Claude Code's .claude/agents/ directory. The       
 modus operandi is "agent creation and coordination" -        
 users interact via @agent-name with intelligent hooks        
 providing workflow automation and suggestions.

 Intelligent workflow automation through enhanced hooks:      
 - Session hooks detect user intent and suggest appropriate   
   agents

   next workflow steps                                        
 - File-based state preservation across agent executions

 Agent-Centric Advantages                                     
                                                              
 - Natural Integration: Works within Claude Code's existing  
   @agent-name interface                                      
 - Intelligent Coordination: Hooks provide smart            
   suggestions and automation                                 
 - State Preservation: File-based coordination maintains     
   context across sessions                                    
 - Specialized Expertise: Each agent has deep domain        
   knowledge and optimal model selection                     
 - Cost Optimization: Strategic model usage (Opus for       
   analysis, Sonnet for implementation, Gemini for security) 
                                                              
 Workflow Completeness                                        
                                                              
 - Complete Coverage: From business idea (TOP_OF_WORKFLOW)   
   to production code (CG agents)                            
 - Quality Assurance: Built-in TDD methodology and          
   specialized reviews                                        
 - Documentation: Comprehensive documentation generation     
   at every step                                             
 - Recovery: @cg-doctor for workflow diagnostics and        
   state recovery                                            
 - Legacy Support: @cg-legacy for modernizing existing      
   codebases                                                 
                                                              
 This implementation creates a complete agent ecosystem      
 that transforms business ideas into production-ready       
 applications through intelligent coordination and          
 specialized expertise.
