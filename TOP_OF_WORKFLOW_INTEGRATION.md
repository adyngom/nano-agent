 I've analyzed the comprehensive                              
 TOP_OF_WORKFLOW_AUTOMATION.md document and identified a      
 brilliant strategic enhancement to our ARTIST framework.     
 This addresses the critical "idea-to-PRD" phase that         
 determines project success, working perfectly with the       
 adyngom/saas-starter foundation.
