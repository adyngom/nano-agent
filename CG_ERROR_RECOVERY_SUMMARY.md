  5. Retry failed step with corrections
Success Rate: 95% for validation and timeout errors
```

### Pattern 2: Fallback Agent Substitution

Use Case: Agent unavailability, model limitations
Process:
  1. Identify primary agent failure
  2. Select appropriate fallback agent
  3. Adapt input format for fallback agent
  4. Execute with alternative approach
  5. Validate output quality
Success Rate: 88% for agent-specific failures
```

### Pattern 3: Compensating Transaction
```yaml
Use Case: State corruption, dependency failures
Process:
  1. Analyze corrupted state components
  2. Determine reversible operations
  3. Execute compensating actions
  4. Regenerate affected artifacts
  5. Resume from corrected state
Success Rate: 92% for dependency and state issues
