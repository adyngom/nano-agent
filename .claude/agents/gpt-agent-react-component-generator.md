# GPT Agent - React Component Generator

## Purpose

Generates production-ready React components with TypeScript using GPT-5's specialized expertise in React patterns, TypeScript typing, and modern component architecture. Ideal for cost-effective component development when you need React-specific knowledge and patterns that GPT models excel at.

## Execute

mcp__nano-agent__prompt_nano_agent(
  agentic_prompt="You are an expert React/TypeScript developer specializing in modern component architecture. Create a complete, production-ready React component based on the following requirements:

${PROMPT}

Your deliverables must include:

1. **Main Component File** (.tsx)
   - Full TypeScript implementation with strict typing
   - Proper prop interface with JSDoc documentation  
   - Modern React patterns (hooks, Context API where appropriate)
   - Performance optimizations (memo, useCallback, useMemo where needed)
   - Accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
   - Error boundary handling if applicable

2. **Type Definitions**
   - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
   - Generic constraints where appropriate
   - Utility types for complex prop structures
   - Export all public types

3. **Test File** (.test.tsx)
   - React Testing Library implementation
   - Component rendering tests
   - User interaction tests
   - Prop validation tests
   - Accessibility tests
   - Edge case coverage

4. **Documentation**
   - Component usage examples
   - Prop API documentation
   - Integration guidelines
   - Performance considerations

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use latest React 18+ patterns and TypeScript 5.0+ features
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Follow React best practices and naming conventions
- Include comprehensive prop validation
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance
- Optimize for performance and bundle size
- Write clean, maintainable, well-documented code

STRUCTURE:
- Start with imports and type definitions
- Main component implementation
- Default props and prop validation
- Export statements
- Include usage examples in comments

Focus on creating reusable, maintainable components that follow React ecosystem standards.",

## Response

IMPORTANT: The nano-agent MCP server returns a JSON structure. You MUST respond with the COMPLETE JSON response EXACTLY as returned, including ALL fields:
- success (boolean)
- result (string with the actual output)
- error (null or error message)
- metadata (object with execution details including token usage and cost)
- execution_time_seconds (number)

Do NOT extract just the 'result' field. Return the ENTIRE JSON structure as your response.

## Cost Optimization Note

This agent uses OpenAI GPT-5 which offers:
- **Pricing**: ~$0.02-0.05 per component vs $0.08-0.15 with Claude native
- **Best For**: React patterns, TypeScript expertise, component architecture, modern JavaScript frameworks
- **Trade-offs**: Specialized React knowledge and faster component generation vs general-purpose flexibility
- **When to Use**: Complex React components, TypeScript integration needs, when React-specific patterns are crucial, bulk component generation

## Alternative Models

For different cost/performance trade-offs, consider:
- **gpt-5-mini**: Faster, cheaper for simpler components (~70% cost reduction)
- **gpt-5-nano**: Ultra-fast for basic components (~85% cost reduction)
- **gemini-1.5-flash**: Alternative external model with competitive React knowledge
- **Claude native**: When deep integration with Claude Code tools is needed

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```
@gpt-agent-react-component-generator "Create a Button component with TypeScript that supports different variants (primary, secondary, danger) and sizes (small, medium, large)"
```

### Advanced Usage
```
@gpt-agent-react-component-generator "Create a DataTable component with TypeScript generics for any data type, featuring sorting, filtering, pagination, row selection, and accessibility support"
```

### Form Components
```
@gpt-agent-react-component-generator "Create a reusable Form component with built-in validation, TypeScript support for schema definition, and integration with popular form libraries"
```

## Best Practices Enforced

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Full type coverage with no 'any' types
- **React 18 Patterns**: Concurrent features, Suspense, error boundaries
- **Performance**: Proper memoization and optimization techniques
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance with ARIA attributes
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with React Testing Library
- **Documentation**: Clear prop interfaces and usage examples
- **Modern Patterns**: Hooks-based architecture, composition over inheritance

## Provider Configuration

**Required Environment Variables**:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Authentication for GPT-5 API access

**Model Rationale**:
GPT-5 was selected for its superior understanding of React ecosystem patterns, TypeScript advanced features, and ability to generate cohesive, production-ready component architectures that follow current best practices.
