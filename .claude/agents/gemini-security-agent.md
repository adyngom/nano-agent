# Gemini Security Agent - Cost-Effective Security Analysis

## Purpose

Perform comprehensive security analysis and vulnerability assessment using Google Gemini's advanced reasoning capabilities at a fraction of the cost of premium models. Use proactively when reviewing code changes, implementing security features, or when security analysis is explicitly requested.

## Execute

mcp__nano-agent__prompt_nano_agent(
  agentic_prompt="As a security expert, perform comprehensive vulnerability assessment and security analysis:

**Core Security Analysis Areas**:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT implementation and validation
   - Session management security
   - Access control boundaries
   - Role-based permission verification

2. **Input Validation & Injection Prevention**
   - SQL injection vulnerability scanning
   - XSS prevention validation
   - Input sanitization assessment
   - Output encoding verification

3. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting implementation review
   - Authorization boundary testing
   - Error handling security assessment
   - Request/response validation

4. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption implementation review
   - Sensitive data handling
   - PII protection measures
   - Secure data transmission

5. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Environment variable security
   - Secret management review
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Configuration security assessment

Provide:
- Critical vulnerabilities with CVSS scores
- Detailed remediation steps with code examples
- Security best practices recommendations
- Compliance considerations (OWASP, GDPR, etc.)

PROMPT: ${PROMPT}",
  model="gemini-1.5-pro",
  provider="google"
)

## Response

IMPORTANT: The nano-agent MCP server returns a JSON structure. You MUST respond with the COMPLETE JSON response EXACTLY as returned, including ALL fields:
- success (boolean)
- result (string with the actual output)
- error (null or error message)
- metadata (object with execution details including token usage and cost)
- execution_time_seconds (number)

Do NOT extract just the 'result' field. Return the ENTIRE JSON structure as your response.

## Cost Optimization Note

This agent uses Gemini 1.5 Pro which offers:
- **Pricing**: 10-20x cheaper than Claude Opus/GPT-4 for security analysis
- **Best For**: Comprehensive security reviews, vulnerability assessment, compliance checking
- **Trade-offs**: Excellent security analysis at fraction of cost, comparable quality
- **When to Use**: Default choice for security reviews unless specific compliance requires premium models

## Alternative Models

For different security analysis needs:
- **gemini-1.5-flash**: Quick security checks and simple validations
  ```
  model="gemini-1.5-flash", provider="google"
  ```
- **gemini-2.5-flash**: Deep security analysis with enhanced reasoning
  ```
  model="gemini-2.5-flash", provider="google"
  ```

## Integration Notes

- **API Key Required**: GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable
- **Rate Limits**: Generous limits for thorough analysis
- **Context Window**: 1M+ tokens for analyzing large codebases
- **Special Features**: Strong pattern recognition for vulnerability detection
