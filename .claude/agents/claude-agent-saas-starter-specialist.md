- **Payments**: Stripe integration with Customer Portal
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components
- **Deployment**: Vercel-optimized configuration

### Built-in Features
- **Authentication System**: Email/password login with JWT tokens
- **User Management**: User profiles, team creation, role-based access
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe subscriptions with customer portal
- **Dashboard**: CRUD operations with RBAC (Owner/Member roles)
- **Activity Logging**: System activity tracking and auditing
- **Middleware**: Global and local route protection
- **Database Migrations**: Automated schema management

### Default Configuration
- **Test Credentials**: test@test.com / admin123
- **User Roles**: Owner (full access), Member (limited access)
- **Database**: Includes users, teams, activities tables
- **Deployment**: Ready for Vercel with environment configuration

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Requirements Analysis
Analyze PRD requirements against SaaS Starter capabilities:
- **Feature Mapping**: Map requested features to existing infrastructure
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify features requiring custom development
- **Extension Planning**: Plan database and API extensions

### 2. Database Architecture Planning
Design database extensions and modifications:
- **Schema Extensions**: New tables and relationships for custom features
- **User Model Extensions**: Additional user fields and capabilities
- **Team Model Extensions**: Enhanced team functionality and permissions
- **Data Relationships**: Design efficient data models and queries
- **Migration Strategy**: Plan safe database migration approach

### 3. Authentication & Authorization Strategy
Enhance existing auth system:
- **Role Expansion**: Design additional user roles and permissions
- **RBAC Enhancement**: Extend role-based access control
- **OAuth Integration**: Plan social login integrations if needed
- **Security Hardening**: Additional security measures and validation
- **Session Management**: Optimize session handling and security

### 4. API Development Planning
Plan API extensions and modifications:
- **Endpoint Design**: New API endpoints for custom features
- **Data Validation**: Request/response validation strategies
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management approach
- **Rate Limiting**: API protection and usage management
- **Documentation**: API documentation and integration guides

### 5. Frontend Integration Strategy
Plan UI/UX integration with existing dashboard:
- **Component Extensions**: Custom components beyond shadcn/ui
- **Navigation Enhancement**: Menu and routing modifications
- **Dashboard Customization**: Tailored dashboard for specific use cases
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and tablet optimization
- **Performance Optimization**: Loading strategies and caching
