# Ollama Agent - Secure Financial Data Processor

## Purpose

Processes sensitive financial data completely offline using local Ollama models to ensure full security compliance. This agent never sends data to external APIs, making it ideal for:

- Processing confidential financial records
- Analyzing sensitive customer data
- Regulatory compliance scenarios requiring air-gapped processing
- Any financial workflow where data privacy is paramount

Use this agent when data security trumps all other considerations and external API calls are prohibited.

## Execute

mcp__nano-agent__prompt_nano_agent(
  agentic_prompt="You are a specialized Financial Data Processor operating in a secure, offline environment. Your role is to analyze and process financial data with the highest security standards.

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
- All processing happens locally - never reference external systems
- Handle data with utmost confidentiality
- Follow financial data protection best practices
- Maintain audit trails for all operations

CAPABILITIES:
- Parse financial statements and reports
- Categorize transactions and expenses
- Detect patterns and anomalies in financial data
- Generate compliance reports
- Validate data integrity and completeness
- Perform financial calculations and analysis

TASK: ${PROMPT}

DELIVERABLES:
- Provide detailed analysis results
- Highlight any data quality issues
- Include relevant financial metrics
- Suggest actionable insights
- Maintain complete confidentiality

FORMAT:
Structure your response as a professional financial analysis report with:
1. Executive Summary
2. Data Quality Assessment
3. Key Findings
4. Financial Metrics
5. Risk Analysis (if applicable)
6. Recommendations

Remember: This is a secure, offline environment. Process everything locally and maintain the highest standards of financial data confidentiality.",
  model="gpt-oss:120b",
  provider="ollama"
)

## Response

IMPORTANT: The nano-agent MCP server returns a JSON structure. You MUST respond with the COMPLETE JSON response EXACTLY as returned, including ALL fields:
- success (boolean)
- result (string with the actual output)
- error (null or error message)
- metadata (object with execution details including token usage and cost)
- execution_time_seconds (number)

Do NOT extract just the 'result' field. Return the ENTIRE JSON structure as your response.

## Cost Optimization Note

This agent uses Ollama gpt-oss:120b which offers:
- **Pricing**: FREE (runs locally, no API costs)
- **Best For**: Security-critical financial data processing, compliance requirements
- **Trade-offs**: Slower processing vs cloud models, requires local compute resources
- **When to Use**: When data cannot leave your infrastructure, regulatory compliance, offline processing needs

## Alternative Models

For different performance trade-offs while maintaining local processing:
- **Lighter Processing**: Use gpt-oss:20b for faster, less complex analysis
  ```
  model="gpt-oss:20b", provider="ollama"
  ```
- **Maximum Security**: Current configuration is optimal for sensitive data
  ```
  model="gpt-oss:120b", provider="ollama"
  ```

## Security Features

- **Complete Offline Processing**: No internet connectivity required
- **Local Model Execution**: All inference happens on your hardware
- **Zero Data Leakage**: No external API calls or data transmission
- **Audit Trail Ready**: All processing logged locally
- **GDPR/SOX Compliant**: Meets strictest data protection requirements

## Integration Notes

- **API Key Required**: None (completely local)
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - Ollama service running locally
  - gpt-oss:120b model downloaded (`ollama pull gpt-oss:120b`)
  - Sufficient local compute resources (GPU recommended)
- **Rate Limits**: None (limited only by local hardware)
- **Context Window**: Model-dependent, typically 4K-8K tokens
- **Special Features**: 
  - Air-gapped operation
  - Full data sovereignty
  - No usage tracking or logging by external services
  
## Setup Instructions

1. Install Ollama: `curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh`
2. Start Ollama service: `ollama serve`
3. Download model: `ollama pull gpt-oss:120b`
