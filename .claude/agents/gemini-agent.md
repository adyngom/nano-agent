# Gemini Agent - Google AI Integration

## Purpose

Leverage Google's Gemini models through the nano-agent MCP server for cost-effective AI assistance with enhanced reasoning capabilities. Use when you need competitive pricing with strong performance for development tasks, analysis, and complex problem solving.

## Execute

mcp__nano-agent__prompt_nano_agent(
  agentic_prompt="${PROMPT}",
  model="gemini-1.5-flash",
  provider="google"
)

## Response

IMPORTANT: The nano-agent MCP server returns a JSON structure. You MUST respond with the COMPLETE JSON response EXACTLY as returned, including ALL fields:
- success (boolean)
- result (string with the actual output)
- error (null or error message)
- metadata (object with execution details including token usage and cost)
- execution_time_seconds (number)

Do NOT extract just the 'result' field. Return the ENTIRE JSON structure as your response.

## Cost Optimization Note

This agent uses Google Gemini models which offer:
- **Pricing**: Highly competitive (often 10-20x cheaper than GPT-4/Claude)
- **Best For**: General development, code generation, analysis, documentation
- **Trade-offs**: Excellent reasoning at fraction of cost, may need more specific prompting
- **When to Use**: Default choice for most tasks unless Claude native features needed

## Alternative Models

For different cost/performance trade-offs:
- **gemini-1.5-flash**: Default - fast and cost-effective
  ```
  model="gemini-1.5-flash", provider="google"
  ```
- **gemini-1.5-pro**: Production-grade development
  ```
  model="gemini-1.5-pro", provider="google"
  ```
- **gemini-2.5-flash**: Enhanced reasoning for complex analysis
  ```
  model="gemini-2.5-flash", provider="google"
  ```
- **gemini-2.0-flash**: Cutting-edge research and advanced tasks
  ```
  model="gemini-2.0-flash", provider="google"
  ```

## Integration Notes

- **API Key Required**: GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable
- **Rate Limits**: Generous limits, varies by model tier
- **Context Window**: 1M+ tokens on most models
- **Special Features**: Multimodal capabilities, code execution, strong reasoning
