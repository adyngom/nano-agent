Project: InvoiceFlow Pro (Freelancer Task & Invoicing App)
Generated: 2025-08-13

1) Detected artifacts (files found in repo):
- PRD_FreelancerInvoice.md → Comprehensive product requirements (MVP, features, tech stack, roadmap).
- UX_STRATEGY_FreelancerInvoice.md → Detailed UI/UX strategy, component system, design timeline.
- Multiple CG_* workflow docs (templates and protocols) present.
- Python app present at apps/nano_agent_mcp_server with pyproject.toml (likely separate service or tooling).

Files NOT found that are relevant to a Node/Next.js SaaS starter:
- package.json (no Node/Next.js app scaffold detected at repo root)
- .github/ (no GitHub Actions/workflows or issue templates detected)
- prisma/schema.prisma or migrations (no DB schema found for Node stack)
- docker/Dockerfile or docker-compose (no container infra found)
- README indicates project, but repo lacks Next.js frontend/backend scaffold required by PRD

2) SaaS foundation assessment
- Current repo has design and product artifacts (PRD + UX) -> pre-development artifacts are present and appear mature.
- No Node-based SaaS starter found (no package.json, no Next.js app). The PRD expects a Next.js + Prisma + Node.js stack.
- There is a Python service (pyproject.toml) — could be tooling or unrelated backend. Confirm whether this Python component is intended as part of InvoiceFlow Pro or is infrastructure for agents.

Minimum foundation required for technical implementation (recommended):
- package.json with Node 20+ engines; Next.js 14 scaffold (app router)
- TypeScript, tRPC (optional), React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Prisma schema and migrations, or equivalent ORM setup
- PostgreSQL dev configuration (.env.sample with DB URL)
- Stripe keys placeholders in .env.sample
- Redis / queue (Bull) config placeholders
- CI/CD pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yml) and basic deployment config (vercel.json or Dockerfile)
- Issue templates and GitHub project board configuration (or equivalent project management)

3) Project phase determination and routing decision
- PRD and UX files exist and are implementation-ready. This is "Partial Completion" toward pre-development: business and UX strategy are present.
- However repository lacks a Node/Next.js SaaS foundation and I don't detect GitHub automation (issues / project board). Therefore the workflow routing falls into the "PRD/UX exist but no GitHub setup (Partial Completion)" path.

Routing decision (actionable):
- Execute Step 3: Coordinate with @project-orchestrator-expert to create GitHub Issues (epics, milestones, MVP backlog) derived from PRD feature sets.
- Execute Step 4: Coordinate with @project-board-manager-expert to create a project board (e.g., GitHub Projects or Jira) and populate it with the created issues and workflows.
- Validate / establish SaaS foundation: route to @saas-starter-specialist to scaffold the Next.js + Prisma starter (or confirm an alternate preferred stack). If the Python service in apps/ is intended to be used, coordinate architecture decisions with the engineering lead.
- After GitHub Issues, Project Board and SaaS foundation are in place, route to @cg-analyzer for issue-based technical development.

4) Recommended immediate next steps (ordered)
(Owner tags provided for handoff)

A. Confirm scope & ownership (You / Product Owner)
- Confirm that PRD_FreelancerInvoice.md and UX_STRATEGY_FreelancerInvoice.md reflect the final scope for MVP.
- Confirm whether apps/nano_agent_mcp_server (Python) is part of Product or infra. NOTE: If relevant, document expected responsibilities for that service.

B. Project orchestration (assign)
- Task: Create initial GitHub epics and issues from PRD MVP features (F1-F4) + acceptance criteria. (Assign: @project-orchestrator-expert)
  - Suggested epics: Foundation, Invoices, Payments, Client Portal, Time & Expense, Reporting, Mobile
  - Suggested issue templates: feature, bug, chore, tech-debt
  - Suggested milestones: Foundation Week1-2, Core Month1-3

- Task: Create Project Board and workflows (To do, In progress, Review, QA, Done). (Assign: @project-board-manager-expert)
  - Populate the board with the epics and highest-priority stories for the first 6 weeks.

C. SaaS foundation setup (Assign: @saas-starter-specialist)
- Deliverables:
  1. Scaffold a Next.js 14 TypeScript monorepo (apps/web, apps/api, packages/*) or a single Next.js app as preferred.
  2. package.json, pnpm workspace (or yarn/npm), tsconfig.json, .eslintrc, .prettierrc
  3. Prisma setup (schema.prisma, initial models for User, Invoice, Client, TimeEntry) and migrations
  4. .env.sample with DB, STRIPE keys, EMAIL_SERVER, REDIS_URL placeholders
  5. Basic authentication (NextAuth/email magic link) stubbed with mock provider
  6. Stripe integration scaffold (webhook endpoint + test keys) and background job queue (Bull) placeholder
  7. GitHub Actions CI pipeline that runs lint, tests and deploy preview
  8. README with local dev and seed instructions
  9. Dockerfile and docker-compose for local Postgres + Redis (optional but recommended)

- Proposed commands / checklist for starter:
  - npx create-next-app@latest --typescript --eslint
  - pnpm init -w (if using pnpm workspaces)
  - pnpm add -w prisma @prisma/client
  - npx prisma init
  - add TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui
  - configure GitHub Actions (ci.yml) and CODEOWNERS

D. Issue & board validation (After A-C complete)
- Validate that core issues exist and map to PRD acceptance criteria.
- Link UX mockups and designs to issues (attach Figma links or figma export assets).
- Tag issues with priority, estimate points, and milestone.

E. Handoff to Engineering / Development (Assign: @cg-analyzer after validation)
- Once issues and project board are ready and foundation is scaffolded, handoff for sprint planning and implementation.

5) Recommended GitHub Issue starter list (examples to create)
- Epic: Foundation — tasks: scaffold repo, CI, env, prisma, auth, README
- Epic: Invoice CRUD — tasks: invoice model, API routes, UI components, PDF generation
- Epic: Payments — stripe integration, webhooks, payment status tracking
- Epic: Client Portal — passwordless login, invoice view, payment flow
- Epic: Time & Expense — timer UI, time model, invoice import
- Chore: Setup staging environment and deploy previews
- Chore: Create issue templates and PR template

6) Integration plan between pre-development (PRD/UX) and technical phases
- Map each PRD acceptance criterion to one or more GitHub issues (include testable acceptance criteria in issue body).
- For each major UX flow, attach a design Figma link and a small prototype or screenshot in the issue.
- Ensure each issue references required infra (DB migrations, env variables, external APIs).
- Establish a developer checklist for PR reviews: functional tests, accessibility checks (WCAG AA), performance budgets.
- Create a release checklist for each milestone (deployment, smoke tests, monitoring, analytics events).

7) Risk & open questions for the team (items to resolve quickly)
- Is the intended runtime Node/Next.js (PRD assumes Node) or should the Python service be the backend? Clarify architecture decision.
- Who will own Stripe and payment compliance (PCI concerns)? Legal/Finance must be informed.
- Confirm hosting choice (Vercel + AWS) and whether accounts/credentials are available.
- Decide whether to use monorepo (web + mobile) or separate repos for mobile app.

8) Actionable deliverables I created/updated in the repository
- Created: CG_WORKFLOW_STATE.md (this file) — snapshot of current state, routing decision, and next steps.

9) Suggested immediate messages to send to agents (copy/paste templates)
- To @project-orchestrator-expert:
  "PRD and UX for InvoiceFlow Pro are ready in the repo (PRD_FreelancerInvoice.md, UX_STRATEGY_FreelancerInvoice.md). Please create the initial GitHub epics/issues for the MVP (Foundation, Invoice CRUD, Payments, Client Portal, Time & Expense). Use PRD acceptance criteria as issue descriptions. Priority: Foundation tasks first."

- To @project-board-manager-expert:
  "Please create a project board (GitHub Projects or Jira) with columns: Backlog, To do, In progress, Review, QA, Done. Populate with epics and top-priority stories for Weeks 1-6. Link PRD and UX files to the board description."

- To @saas-starter-specialist:
  "Repo has PRD and UX but no Node/Next.js scaffold. Please scaffold a Next.js 14 TypeScript starter with Prisma, Tailwind, basic auth and Stripe webhook stub. Provide README + .env.sample + CI pipeline."

- To @cg-analyzer (post-setup):
  "Once issues, board and foundation are ready, please perform a technical assessment and begin sprint-based implementation. Focus first on Foundation epic then Invoice CRUD."

10) Next steps for you (user)
- Confirm whether apps/nano_agent_mcp_server (Python) is part of this product.
- Confirm priority for MVP scope (if any features should be removed or added).
- Assign the agent roles above and authorize repo changes (scaffold, CI, project board creation).

---
Status: Partial Completion detected (PRD + UX present). Action required: Create GitHub Issues and Project Board; scaffold SaaS foundation (Next.js/Prisma) to match PRD tech assumptions.

If you want, I can:
- Generate a prioritized backlog (GitHub issue bodies) from the PRD and save them as markdown files for quick import/creation.
- Scaffold a starter package.json and a minimal Next.js app skeleton in this repo (I will create files and run no commands).

Tell me which of the follow-up tasks you want me to do next:
1) Generate backlog issue markdowns for quick import
2) Scaffold minimal Next.js + package.json + README + .env.sample
3) Create GitHub issue templates and a sample CI workflow file
4) Other (describe)
