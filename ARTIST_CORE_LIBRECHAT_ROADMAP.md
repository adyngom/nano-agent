# ARTIST Core LibreChat Integration Roadmap
## 6-Week MVP Timeline

### Executive Summary
Aggressive 6-week timeline to deliver ARTIST Core as a LibreChat **agent** with MCP and OpenAPI actions. LibreChat deprecated plugins in favor of agents architecture. Leveraging existing building blocks: LibreChat agents foundation, proven nano-agent MCP, ARTIST methodology validation from MetricFlow POC, and 25 years of SWE experience + Claude Sonnet/Opus support.

## Week 1: Foundation Setup & Architecture
**Days 1-2: Environment & Agent Structure**
- Clone and setup LibreChat development environment
- Study LibreChat agents architecture and MCP integration patterns
- Create ARTIST agent configuration and directory structure
- Configure agent development workflow and testing framework

**Days 3-5: MCP Agent Foundation**
- Integrate nano-agent MCP server as LibreChat agent
- Configure MCP server registration and agent discovery
- Implement ARTIST-specific MCP tools and capabilities
- Build agent state management and context preservation

**Weekend: Agent Integration Testing**
- Test MCP agent registration and discovery
- Validate basic ARTIST workflow through LibreChat interface
- Performance baseline testing

## Week 2: OpenAPI Actions & Advanced MCP Tools
**Days 1-3: OpenAPI Actions Implementation**
- Design ARTIST workflow OpenAPI specification

- Failover and recovery validation

## Week 6: MVP Launch Preparation
**Days 1-2: Documentation & Training**
- Complete user documentation
- Create developer onboarding guides
- Build demonstration projects
- Prepare launch materials

**Days 3-4: Final Testing & Bug Fixes**
- End-to-end user acceptance testing
- Critical bug resolution
- Performance fine-tuning
- Security final review

**Day 5: MVP Launch**
- Production deployment
- Launch announcement
- Initial user onboarding

## Success Metrics
- **Cost Optimization**: Achieve 94.8% cost reduction through nano-agent MCP
- **Performance**: 3x speed improvement via parallel execution
- **Usability**: Complete ARTIST project in under 30 minutes
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for agent orchestration
- **Adoption**: 10+ validated ARTIST projects by week 6

## Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Risk**: Daily integration testing prevents accumulation of issues
- **Timeline Risk**: Parallel development streams with weekly milestones
- **Quality Risk**: Continuous testing and validation throughout sprints
- **Scope Risk**: MVP-focused feature set with clear enhancement roadmap

## Post-MVP Roadmap (Weeks 7-12)
