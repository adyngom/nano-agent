# MetricFlow Team Onboarding Guide
**ARTIST Methodology Project Board for Subscription Analytics SaaS**

## Welcome to MetricFlow Development

This guide will help you understand and effectively use our GitHub project board that implements the ARTIST methodology for systematic delivery of the MetricFlow subscription analytics platform.

## üìã Project Overview

- **Product**: MetricFlow - Subscription analytics for small businesses
- **Timeline**: 4-month delivery with 7 systematic sprints
- **Total Issues**: 35 GitHub issues organized into 5 major epics
- **Methodology**: ARTIST (Agile Research Through Iterative Software Testing)
- **Team Structure**: UX, UI, Dev, QA, DevOps, Business teams

## üèóÔ∏è Board Architecture

### ARTIST Methodology Columns

Our project board follows the ARTIST workflow with these columns:

1. **üìã Backlog** - New issues awaiting analysis and prioritization
2. **üîç Analysis** - Issues undergoing AI-driven analysis and research
3. **üìÖ Sprint Planning** - Issues ready for sprint assignment and team allocation
4. **üîÑ In Progress** - Active development work with team assignments
5. **üëÄ Code Review** - Development complete, awaiting peer review
6. **üß™ Testing** - Issues in QA validation and testing phase
7. **üöÄ Deployment** - Issues ready for or undergoing deployment
8. **‚úÖ Done** - Completed and verified issues

### Automation Flow

Issues automatically move through the workflow based on:
- **Label changes** (analysis-ready, sprint-ready, in-progress)
- **PR creation** (moves to Code Review)
- **PR approval** (moves to Testing)
- **PR merge to main** (moves to Deployment)
- **Issue closure** (moves to Done)
