# ARTIST Implementation Plan
*From Business Inquiry to Production SaaS - Leveraging Existing Agent Infrastructure*

## Overview
This document outlines how to implement the ARTIST methodology using our existing agent infrastructure in Claude Code CLI, starting with business inquiry triggers through @claude-agent-project-init and building on our proven meta-agent framework.

## Phase 1: ARTIST Integration with Existing Infrastructure

### 1.1 Business Inquiry Trigger System
**Goal**: Accept business ideas through Claude Code CLI and initiate ARTIST workflow

#### Trigger Methods (Using Existing Infrastructure)
```yaml
primary_trigger:
  user_inquiry: "I want to build a platform for freelancers to manage clients"
  auto_detection: "Session hooks detect project creation intent"
  agent_suggestion: "System suggests @claude-agent-project-init"
  manual_trigger: "User explicitly calls @claude-agent-project-init"

workflow_initiation:
  entry_point: "@claude-agent-project-init"
  detection_logic: "Analyzes project state and routes to appropriate workflow"
  agent_coordination: "Leverages existing agent orchestra for ARTIST phases"
```

#### Business Inquiry Structure
```typescript
interface BusinessInquiry {
  // Core Requirements
  businessIdea: string;           // "Build a platform for freelancers to manage clients"
  targetAudience: string;         // "Freelance designers and developers"
  keyPainPoints: string[];        // ["Invoice management", "Client communication"]
  
  // Optional Context
  competitorReferences?: string[]; // ["FreshBooks", "QuickBooks"]
  revenueModel?: string;          // "Subscription tiers"
  timeline?: string;              // "3 months to MVP"
  budget?: string;                // "Bootstrap/Small budget"
  
  // Technical Preferences
  integrationNeeds?: string[];    // ["Stripe", "Google Calendar"]
  designStyle?: string;           // "Minimal and professional"
  complianceRequirements?: string[]; // ["GDPR", "SOC2"]
}
```

### 1.2 ARTIST Workflow Using Existing Agent Infrastructure

command_equivalents:
  # Instead of: artist create project
  claude_code: "I want to build a freelancer platform"
  suggestion: "@claude-agent-project-init"
  
  # Instead of: artist status
  claude_code: "What's the status of my project?"
  routing: "@claude-agent-project-init checks state"
  
  # Instead of: artist agent business-analyst
  claude_code: "@claude-agent-business-analyst analyze market for freelance tools"
  
  # Instead of: artist issues list
  claude_code: "Show me the GitHub issues for this project"
  execution: "Agent uses existing GitHub MCP integration"
```

### 2.2 Configuration Management

- "Help me create a SaaS..." â†’ Trigger business inquiry workflow  
- "Let's start a new project..." â†’ Route to ARTIST methodology

### 3. Agent Coordination Improvements
Enhance @claude-agent-project-init to:
- Better detect project state (PRD, UX files, GitHub setup)
- Coordinate sequential agent handoffs (Agents 1â†’2â†’3â†’4)
- Maintain workflow state between agent interactions
- Generate project status reports and next steps

### 4. Dynamic Agent Creation Testing
Test agent factories for project-specific needs:
```bash
@claude-agent-factory "Create a payment integration specialist for fintech SaaS"
@nano-agent-factory "Create a cost-optimized content generator for blog posts"
```
