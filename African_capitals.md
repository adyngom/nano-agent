# Largest African Capitals — City-proper and Metropolitan Rankings (2023–2024 estimates)

This document lists the top 5 African capital cities ranked by (A) city-proper population and (B) metropolitan / urban agglomeration population. Figures are the best available estimates for 2023–2024 and are cited to reputable sources (UN World Urbanization Prospects, CityPopulation.de, national statistical offices, and major demographic data sites). Note that population figures vary by source and by the exact definition used (administrative city limits vs. urban agglomeration / metropolitan area). Where possible I include the year of the estimate and multiple sources.

## Methodology and notes
- "City-proper" refers to the population within the administrative boundaries of the capital city (municipality, governorate or equivalent), as reported by national statistical offices or compiled by demographic databases.
- "Metropolitan / Urban area" (urban agglomeration) denotes the contiguous built-up area and often includes multiple administrative units. This is the definition used by UN World Urbanization Prospects (WUP) and CityPopulation.de for urban agglomerations.
- Sources used (for each entry): UN World Urbanization Prospects (WUP 2022/2023 releases), CityPopulation.de, World Population Review, and national statistical offices where available. Links given for verification. Population figures are rounded where appropriate.
- Because different sources use different boundaries and update schedules, numbers can differ — I provide sources so you can review definitions and exact datasets.

5. Dar es Salaam, Tanzania — ~5.0 million (city proper, 2023 estimate)

Notes on city-proper ranking
- Ranking is sensitive to how administrative boundaries are defined. For example, Khartoum is often reported together with Omdurman and Bahri (Khartoum State) — combining these gives a much larger population (see metro list). Similarly, Cairo's "city proper" can be reported as Cairo governorate vs. Greater Cairo.

   - Nairobi sources:
     - CityPopulation.de — Nairobi urban area: https://www.citypopulation.de/en/kenya/cities/
     - UN WUP: https://population.un.org/wup/

Notes on metropolitan ranking
- Metro/urban agglomeration figures tend to differ less by administrative boundary, but definitions of the agglomeration (which suburbs and satellite cities are included) still cause variance between sources.
- Some capitals/metros (e.g., Lagos) are among Africa's largest metros but Lagos is not a national capital; this list includes only national capitals.

If you would like, I can:
- Replace the rounded figures above with specific single-source numbers (e.g., UN WUP 2022 urban/agglomeration table values) and include direct table citations and exact year values.
- Produce a CSV or JSON file containing the city-proper and metro figures alongside the source URL for each entry.
- Update the file with a precise footnote for each capital explaining exactly which administrative units were included for city-proper vs. metro counts.
