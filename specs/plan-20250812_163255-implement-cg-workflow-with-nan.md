## Task Description
Implement CG Workflow with Nano-Agent Model Switching

## Objective
Implement your Revised CG Workflow using the nano-agent MCP server to achieve reliable LLM/model switching for your three specialized agents: tdd-issue-analyzer (Claude Opus 4.1), tdd-issue-planner (Claude Sonnet 4), and tdd-issue-implementer (Claude Sonnet 4).

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

### 1. Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
## Plan: Implement CG Workflow with Nano-Agent Model Switching

### Objective ✅ COMPLETED
Implement your Revised CG Workflow using the nano-agent MCP server to achieve reliable LLM/model switching for your three specialized agents: tdd-issue-analyzer (Claude Opus 4.1), tdd-issue-planner (Claude Sonnet 4), and tdd-issue-implementer (Claude Sonnet 4).

### Implementation Strategy ✅ COMPLETED
Use the nano-agent MCP server's proven multi-provider architecture to create CG-specific agent configurations that delegate to the exact models your workflow requires.

### Step-by-Step Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1. Create CG Agent Configurations ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Create `.claude/agents/artist/cg-analyzer.md` (Claude Opus 4.1 for CTO-level analysis)
- ✅ Create `.claude/agents/artist/cg-planner.md` (Claude Sonnet 4 for test strategy)  
- ✅ Create `.claude/agents/artist/cg-implementer.md` (Claude Sonnet 4 for TDD development)
- ✅ Each agent delegates to nano-agent MCP server with specific model parameters

#### 2. Implement CG Workflow Commands ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Create `/cg-issue` command that sequentially delegates to the three agents
- ✅ Create `/cg-init`, `/cg-legacy`, `/cg-resume`, `/cg-doctor`, `/cg-test` commands
- ✅ Each command uses appropriate nano-agent model for cost optimization

### Implementation Summary ✅ COMPLETED
**Phase 1: CG Agent Configurations** 
- Created 3 specialized agents in `.claude/agents/artist/` folder
- Each agent configured with optimal model selection for cost/performance
- Proper delegation to nano-agent MCP server with model-specific parameters

**Phase 2: CG Workflow Commands**
- Created 6 comprehensive workflow commands in `.claude/commands/artist/` folder
- Sequential delegation workflow implemented (analyzer → planner → implementer)
- Cost-optimized model selection strategy implemented
- Comprehensive error handling and state management

**Files Created:**
1. `.claude/agents/artist/cg-analyzer.md` - Claude Opus 4.1 for deep analysis
2. `.claude/agents/artist/cg-planner.md` - Claude Sonnet 4 for test strategy  
3. `.claude/agents/artist/cg-implementer.md` - Claude Sonnet 4 for TDD implementation
4. `.claude/commands/artist/cg-issue.md` - Main workflow orchestration
5. `.claude/commands/artist/cg-init.md` - Project initialization
6. `.claude/commands/artist/cg-legacy.md` - Legacy code modernization
7. `.claude/commands/artist/cg-resume.md` - Explicit resume functionality
8. `.claude/commands/artist/cg-doctor.md` - Workflow health checks
9. `.claude/commands/artist/cg-test.md` - Independent test runner

### 2. Validation - READY FOR TESTING
- Test the implementation thoroughly
- Verify all requirements are met
- Run any applicable test suites

**Next Steps for Validation:**
1. Test agent delegation and model switching: `@agent-cg-analyzer "Test analysis"`
2. Test workflow command execution: `/cg-issue 123`
3. Verify cost optimization through targeted model usage
4. Validate GitHub integration and board state management
5. Test error handling and resume functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
- Implementation matches the approved plan
- All functionality works as expected
- Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Validation Commands
Execute these commands to validate the task is complete:

- `uv run python -m py_compile apps/nano_agent_mcp_server/src/**/*.py` - Test code compilation
- Run any applicable test suites
- Verify functionality through manual testing
