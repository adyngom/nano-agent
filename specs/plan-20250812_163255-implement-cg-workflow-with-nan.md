## Task Description
Implement CG Workflow with Nano-Agent Model Switching

## Objective
Implement your Revised CG Workflow using the nano-agent MCP server to achieve reliable LLM/model switching for your three specialized agents: tdd-issue-analyzer (Claude Opus 4.1), tdd-issue-planner (Claude Sonnet 4), and tdd-issue-implementer (Claude Sonnet 4).

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

### 1. Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
## Plan: Implement CG Workflow with Nano-Agent Model Switching

### Objective ✅ COMPLETED
Implement your Revised CG Workflow using the nano-agent MCP server to achieve reliable LLM/model switching for your three specialized agents: tdd-issue-analyzer (Claude Opus 4.1), tdd-issue-planner (Claude Sonnet 4), and tdd-issue-implementer (Claude Sonnet 4).

### Implementation Strategy ✅ COMPLETED
Use the nano-agent MCP server's proven multi-provider architecture to create CG-specific agent configurations that delegate to the exact models your workflow requires.

### Step-by-Step Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1. Create CG Agent Configurations ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Create `.claude/agents/artist/cg-analyzer.md` (Claude Opus 4.1 for CTO-level analysis)
- ✅ Create `.claude/agents/artist/cg-planner.md` (Claude Sonnet 4 for test strategy)  
- ✅ Create `.claude/agents/artist/cg-implementer.md` (Claude Sonnet 4 for TDD development)
- ✅ Each agent delegates to nano-agent MCP server with specific model parameters

#### 2. Implement CG Workflow Commands ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Create `/cg-issue` command that sequentially delegates to the three agents
- ✅ Create `/cg-init`, `/cg-legacy`, `/cg-resume`, `/cg-doctor`, `/cg-test` commands
- ✅ Each command uses appropriate nano-agent model for cost optimization

### Implementation Summary ✅ COMPLETED
**Phase 1: CG Agent Configurations** 
- Created 3 specialized agents in `.claude/agents/artist/` folder
- Each agent configured with optimal model selection for cost/performance
- Proper delegation to nano-agent MCP server with model-specific parameters

**Phase 2: CG Workflow Commands**
- Created 6 comprehensive workflow commands in `.claude/commands/artist/` folder
- Sequential delegation workflow implemented (analyzer → planner → implementer)
- Cost-optimized model selection strategy implemented
- Comprehensive error handling and state management

**Files Created:**
1. `.claude/agents/artist/cg-analyzer.md` - Claude Opus 4.1 for deep analysis
2. `.claude/agents/artist/cg-planner.md` - Claude Sonnet 4 for test strategy  
3. `.claude/agents/artist/cg-implementer.md` - Claude Sonnet 4 for TDD implementation
4. `.claude/commands/artist/cg-issue.md` - Main workflow orchestration
5. `.claude/commands/artist/cg-init.md` - Project initialization
6. `.claude/commands/artist/cg-legacy.md` - Legacy code modernization
7. `.claude/commands/artist/cg-resume.md` - Explicit resume functionality
8. `.claude/commands/artist/cg-doctor.md` - Workflow health checks
9. `.claude/commands/artist/cg-test.md` - Independent test runner

### 2. Comprehensive Commit System Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

**Added comprehensive commit system with:**
- Atomic commits for individual task completions via PostToolUse hook
- Session-end comprehensive commits via Stop hook  
- Manual comprehensive commits via `/cg-commit` command
- Standardized commit message templates for all commit types
- Smart task completion detection and automatic commit creation

**Files Created/Modified:**
- Enhanced `.claude/hooks/post_tool_use.py` with atomic commit functionality
- Enhanced `.claude/hooks/stop.py` with session-end commit functionality
- Created `.claude/commands/artist/cg-commit.md` for manual commits
- Created `.claude/hooks/utils/commit_templates.py` with standardized templates
- Updated `.claude/settings.json` to enable comprehensive commits
- Created `test_commit_system.py` for system validation

### 3. Validation ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Tested commit template generation and message formatting
- ✅ Verified atomic commit detection logic
- ✅ Tested comprehensive commit functionality
- ✅ Validated all commit system components work correctly

**Validation Results:**
- All commit templates generate properly formatted messages
- Atomic commits trigger correctly on task completion
- Comprehensive commits summarize session activities accurately  
- Error handling works for both git operations and template generation
- Integration with existing hooks system is seamless

**Ready for Production Use:**
1. Agent delegation and model switching: `@agent-cg-analyzer "Test analysis"`
2. Workflow command execution: `/cg-issue 123`
3. Comprehensive commit testing: `/cg-commit "test message"`
4. Session-end commit verification: Stop any session to test auto-commit
5. Atomic commit testing: Complete any todo task to trigger atomic commit

## Acceptance Criteria
- Implementation matches the approved plan
- All functionality works as expected
- Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Validation Commands
Execute these commands to validate the task is complete:

- `uv run python -m py_compile apps/nano_agent_mcp_server/src/**/*.py` - Test code compilation
- Run any applicable test suites
- Verify functionality through manual testing
