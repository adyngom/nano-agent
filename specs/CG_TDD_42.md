# CG_TDD Analysis: Issue #42 - CSV Export Functionality

## Analysis Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis for implementing CSV export functionality in the nano-agent system. The feature will allow users to export evaluation results, performance metrics, and agent interaction data in CSV format for further analysis.

## Issue Context

**Issue #42**: Add CSV export functionality for evaluation results and performance data
- Enable data export for external analysis tools
- Support multiple data types (evaluation results, performance metrics, logs)
- Provide filtering and customization options
- Ensure data privacy and security in exports

## Technical Analysis

### Core Components Required

1. **CSV Export Engine** (`modules/csv_exporter.py`)
   - Generic CSV generation utilities
   - Data formatting and sanitization
   - Field mapping and selection
   - Memory-efficient streaming for large datasets

2. **Export Data Models** (`modules/export_models.py`)
   - Data structure definitions for exportable content
   - Field validation and type conversion
   - Privacy filtering mechanisms
   - Export metadata tracking

3. **Export API Endpoints** (`api/export_routes.py`)
   - REST endpoints for triggering exports
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Export job management
   - Download link generation

4. **CLI Export Commands** (`cli/export_commands.py`)
   - Command-line interface for exports
   - Batch export capabilities
   - Progress tracking and status reporting

### Data Sources for Export

1. **Evaluation Results**
   - HOP/LOP test results
   - Model performance comparisons
   - Token usage and cost data
   - Success/failure rates

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Response times
   - Throughput measurements
   - Resource utilization
   - Error rates and types

3. **Agent Interaction Logs**
   - Request/response pairs
   - Tool usage patterns
   - Provider-specific metrics
   - Session metadata

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Core CSV Engine
- Create base CSV export utilities
- Implement data sanitization
- Add streaming support for large datasets
- Create configurable field mapping

#### Phase 2: Data Model Integration
- Define exportable data structures
- Implement privacy filtering
- Add field validation and type conversion
- Create export metadata tracking

#### Phase 3: API and CLI Integration
- Add REST endpoints for export requests
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Create CLI commands for batch exports
- Add progress tracking and status reporting

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Custom field selection
- Date range filtering
- Multiple output formats (JSON, XML)
- Scheduled exports

### Security Considerations

1. **Data Privacy**
   - Sanitize sensitive information (API keys, tokens)
   - Implement field-level access controls
   - Add data anonymization options
   - Audit export activities

2. **Access Control**
   - Authenticate export requests
   - Authorize data access based on user roles
   - Rate limit export operations
   - Log all export activities

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Validate data before export
   - Ensure consistent formatting
   - Handle encoding issues properly
   - Verify export completeness

### Performance Optimization

1. **Memory Management**
   - Stream large datasets to avoid memory issues
   - Implement pagination for very large exports
   - Use efficient data structures
   - Clean up temporary files

2. **Scalability**
   - Support concurrent export operations
   - Implement background job processing
   - Add progress tracking for long operations
   - Optimize database queries

### Integration Points

1. **Existing Evaluation System**
   - Hook into HOP/LOP result collection
   - Access performance tracking data
   - Integrate with token tracking system

2. **Provider Integration**
   - Support all provider types (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
   - Handle provider-specific data formats
   - Normalize data across providers

3. **Storage and Retrieval**
   - Integrate with existing data storage
   - Support multiple data sources
   - Implement efficient data retrieval

## Technical Decisions

### CSV Library Choice
**Decision**: Use Python's built-in `csv` module with `pandas` for complex operations
**Rationale**: 
- Built-in `csv` module provides reliable, memory-efficient streaming
- `pandas` offers powerful data manipulation for complex exports
- Both are well-tested and widely supported

### Export Format Strategy
**Decision**: Implement flexible field mapping with configurable output schemas
**Rationale**:
- Different use cases require different field sets
- Users need control over exported data structure
- Future extensibility for additional formats

### Data Storage Approach
**Decision**: Temporary file generation with secure cleanup
**Rationale**:
- Supports large datasets without memory constraints
- Enables resume capability for interrupted downloads
- Provides secure handling of sensitive data

### Authentication Integration
**Decision**: Leverage existing MCP authentication mechanisms
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with current system architecture
- Avoids duplicating authentication logic
- Maintains security standards

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Requirements**
   - Export evaluation results to CSV format
   - Support filtering by date range, provider, model
   - Handle large datasets (>100MB) efficiently
   - Provide progress tracking for long operations

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - Export 10,000 records in under 30 seconds
   - Support concurrent export operations
   - Memory usage under 500MB for any single export
   - 99.9% export success rate

3. **Security Requirements**
   - No sensitive data in exports without explicit permission
   - All exports require authentication
   - Audit trail for all export operations
   - Secure temporary file handling

4. **Usability Requirements**
   - Simple CLI commands for common export scenarios
   - Clear progress indication for long operations
   - Intuitive field selection interface
   - Comprehensive error messages

## Dependencies

### External Libraries
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and CSV generation
- `aiofiles`: Async file operations
- `pydantic`: Data validation and serialization

### Internal Dependencies
- Token tracking system for performance data
- Evaluation result storage
- MCP authentication system

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Memory exhaustion** with very large datasets
  - Mitigation: Implement streaming and pagination
- **Data privacy violations** in exports
  - Mitigation: Strict field filtering and audit logging

### Medium Risk
- **Performance degradation** during large exports
  - Mitigation: Background processing and rate limiting
- **Inconsistent data formatting** across providers
  - Mitigation: Standardized data normalization

### Low Risk
- **File system storage issues**
  - Mitigation: Configurable storage locations and cleanup
- **CSV format compatibility**
  - Mitigation: Standard CSV formatting with configurable options
